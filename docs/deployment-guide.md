# ðŸš€ Deployment Guide

This guide expands on the deployment information in the README, providing detailed instructions for deploying and managing the DigitalOcean SaaS Starter Kit in production.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding with deployment, ensure you have:

- A [DigitalOcean account](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/registrations/new)
- Your application code pushed to a GitHub repository
- A DigitalOcean Spaces bucket created for file storage (see [Storage.md](./storage.md))
- (Optional) A custom domain you want to use for your application

## Deployment Options

You have two main options for deploying to DigitalOcean:

1. **Basic deployment** - Quick and automated, using the Deploy to DigitalOcean button (covered in the README)
2. **Advanced deployment** - More customizable, with additional configuration options (covered here)

## Advanced Configuration Options

This section covers advanced deployment configurations that go beyond the basic setup described in the README.

### Environment Optimization

When configuring your App Platform deployment, consider these optimization options:

1. **Resource Allocation**:
   - For production workloads, select at least the Basic plan with 1GB RAM / 1 CPU
   - For high-traffic applications, consider the Professional plan with multiple instances

2. **Build-time Optimization**:
   - Consider enabling build caching to speed up deployments
   - Set NODE_ENV=production for optimized builds

### Advanced App Configuration

1. **Select repository and branch**:
   - The repository should be pre-selected if you used the Deploy button
   - Choose the branch you want to deploy (usually `main`)

2. **Set up resource type**:
   - Choose the region closest to your target users
   - Select your preferred resources (Basic, Professional, or Premier plan)
   - Recommended starting point: Basic plan with 1GB RAM / 1 CPU

3. **Configure app name and environment variables**:
   - Give your app a descriptive name
   - Set up required environment variables (detailed in Step 4)

### Step 4: Set Environment Variables

The following environment variables are required:

1. **Database Environment Variables**:
   ```
   DATABASE_URL=postgres://username:password@host:port/database
   ```
   - This will be automatically configured if you create a DigitalOcean Managed Database

2. **NextAuth Environment Variables**:
   ```
   NEXTAUTH_URL=https://your-app-name.ondigitalocean.app
   NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-secure-random-string
   ```
   - Generate a secure random string for `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` using a tool like [Password Generator](https://passwords-generator.org/)
   - `NEXTAUTH_URL` should be your app's full URL (will be available after first deployment)

3. **DigitalOcean Spaces Environment Variables**:
   ```
   SPACES_KEY=your-spaces-access-key
   SPACES_SECRET=your-spaces-secret-key
   SPACES_ENDPOINT=your-region.digitaloceanspaces.com
   SPACES_BUCKET=your-bucket-name
   ```
   - Get these values from your DigitalOcean Spaces setup (see [Storage.md](./storage.md))

4. **Application-specific Environment Variables**:
   ```
   APP_URL=https://your-app-name.ondigitalocean.app
   APP_ENV=production
   ```

2. Test key functionality to ensure everything works as expected
3. Check the logs for any errors

### Step 3: Set Up Domain (Optional)

To use a custom domain:

1. In your App Platform dashboard, select your app
2. Go to the **Settings** tab
3. Under **Domains**, click **Add Domain**
4. Follow the instructions to configure your domain's DNS settings

## Scaling Your Application

As your SaaS grows, you can scale your resources:

1. **Vertical Scaling** - Increase the resources (RAM/CPU) of your existing components
   - Go to your App Platform dashboard
   - Select your app
   - Go to **Settings** > **Edit Plan**
   - Select a higher tier plan

2. **Horizontal Scaling** - Add more instances of your application
